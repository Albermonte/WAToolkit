WhatsApp Toolkit aims to be a set of useful and lightweight tools for the new WhatsApp web client.

Currently it makes it possible to receive WhatsApp notifications even when there is no WhatsApp tab or Chrome window at all open. This way you will never miss a message again while working on your PC.

Features:

★ Enables always-on desktop notifications. Chrome will run in background mode permanently, keeping track and showing your WhatsApp notifications instantly.

★ Adds a convenient WhatsApp icon to the toolbar. You can still hide the icon if you want via right click -> Hide button.

★ Extremely lightweight and fast.

★ If the extension raises some interest, new features will come, including themes and any kind of handy utilities. Be sure to suggest new features by clicking on the SUPPORT tab.

———————————————————— HOW TO ————————————————————

New to WhatsApp Web? To start using it, install this extension and click on the Chrome toolbar button with the green WhatsApp icon. The notifications will start working as soon as you log in using the QR code. Remember to check the "keep session opened" checkbox!

———————————————————— KNOWN ISSUES ————————————————————

• When working on background mode, clicking on the notifications has no effect. You will have to open Chrome and go to WhatsApp manually in order to answer your messages.

• If you can't see WhatsApp notifications, please refer to the official support thread to solve the issue: http://www.whatsapp.com/faq/en/web/28080004

———————————————————— PERMISSIONS ————————————————————

The message shown by Google Chrome for the requested permissions are far from the real needs of the extension, but they are technically required for the following reasons:

• Read and change your data on all whatsapp.com sites: Required to detect whether an active WhatsApp session exists, and to create one in the background if it doesn't.

• Read your browsing history: Required for showing the related videos' rating bars inside the player when the video ends in the case of embedded videos.
