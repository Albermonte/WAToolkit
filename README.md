## Unofficial Toolkit for WhatsApp

Never ever miss a WhatsApp notification again while you are on your desktop computer! This extension makes it possible to receive WhatsApp notifications even when there is no WhatsApp tab or Chrome window at all open. This way you will never miss a message again while working on your PC.

### Features

★ **Enables always-on desktop notifications:** Chrome will run in background mode permanently, keeping track and showing your WhatsApp notifications instantly. You can click on the notifications to go directly to the relevant chat.

★ **Adds a convenient WhatsApp button to the toolbar:** It includes the number of unread messages always visible. You can hover the mouse over the icon and you will see a summary of your unread conversations in a tooltip. In addition, the icon will become orange if there's some kind of connectivity issue with your phone. You can still hide the button if you want, just right click on it and select *Hide button*.

★ **Ensures you only have one instance of WhatsApp Web open at any time:** That way you can focus on the right tab in any situation. Moreover, you won't be bothered with WhatsApp's exit confirmation messages any more.

★ **Extremely lightweight and fast:** Coded with performance in mind.

If you still cannot see WhatsApp notifications, please refer to the official support thread to solve the issue: http://www.whatsapp.com/faq/en/web/28080004

### Permissions

The message shown by Google Chrome for the requested permissions is far from the real needs of the extension, but the permissions are technically required for the following reasons:

**• Read and change your data on all whatsapp.com sites:** Required to create the background page that holds an active WhatsApp session.

**• Read your browsing history:** Required to detect whether an active WhatsApp session exists among the tabs you are browsing, avoiding conflicts with the background page.

### Motivation

As all the software I make in my free time, I created this extension because I wanted the functionality it offers for myself. My first need was being able to watch all WhatsApp notifications on my desktop computer, even without a WhatsApp tab opened (or any Chrome window at all), and that was its first feature.

### Future

As the extension has raised some interest, I'll be maintaining Unofficial Toolkit for WhatsApp and new features will probably be added in the future. Be sure to star this project on GitHub, [report bugs or suggest new ideas](https://github.com/cprcrack/Unofficial-Toolkit-for-WhatsApp/issues/new).
