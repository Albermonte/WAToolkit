Unofficial Toolkit for WhatsApp is an extension that aims to be an unofficial set of useful and lightweight tools for WhatsApp Web client that provides better Google Chrome integration. You can check all the features and download it at http://watoolkit.com (redirects to Chrome Web Store).

## Motivation

As all the software I make in my free time, I created this extension because I wanted the functionality it offers for myself. My first need was being able to watch all WhatsApp notifications on my desktop computer, even without a WhatsApp tab opened (or any Chrome window at all), and that was its first feature.

## Future

As the extension has raised some interest, new cool features will probably be added in the future, including themes. Be sure to suggest new ideas.
