# WhatsApp Toolkit

WhatsApp Toolkit is a Chrome extension that aims to be a set of useful and lightweight tools for the new WhatsApp web client. You can check all the features and download it at http://whatsapptoolkit.com (redirects to Chrome Web Store).

## Motivation

As all the software I make in my free time, I created this extension because I wanted the functionality it offers for myself. My first need was being able to watch all WhatsApp notifications on my desktop computer, even without a WhatsApp tab opened (or any Chrome window at all), and that's its main feature right now.

## Future

If the extension raises enough interest, new features will come, including themes and any kind of handy utilities. Be sure to suggest new features.

## License and contributing

WhatsApp Toolkit is free and open source. The source code is released under The GNU General Public License v3.0. Contributions are very welcome.
